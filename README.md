# Emily's Murder Mystery
A mystery game I made on Roblox for my friends at a Halloween party in which my friends would have to solve the mystery behind the murder of Emily (hosted at Emily's house).

Because it's Halloween, all the detectives at the police department were busy trick-or-treating, so I (dressed up as a cop), enlisted the help of Emily's friends
(my friends attending the party) to solve the case themselves.

On Roblox, the players would have access to a copy of her phone and would have to decrypt passwords using hints found in her phone (in texts, pictures, etc.)
along with some secrets hidden around the house. The game would end when the players collectively named:
- the murderer
- the motive
- the time of death

The game as of now isn't playable, since it relies on real-world elements. But, I uploaded this here to potentially use it in the future, and to also show off some of the stuff I was doing before entering University.

Check out some screenshots of the gameplay (these were taken in Roblox Studio and the studio is trying to simulate the frame of an iPhone; the iPhone in the picture is not part of the game):

This game was heavily inspired by Peek-a-Phone
